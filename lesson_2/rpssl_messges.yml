WELCOME: "Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard! This is the same\n
game as the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors we all grew up playing, with\n
some new additions; Spock and Lizard. The rules of the game is as follows:\n

Scissors cuts Paper; Paper covers Rock; Rock crushes Lizard;\n
Lizard poisons Spock; Spock smashes Scissors; Scissors decapitates Lizard;\n
Lizard eats Paper; Paper disproves Spock; Spock vaporizes Rock; and finally\n
Rock crushes Scissors.\

We know that's a lot to take in, so if you'reconfused, don't worry. We'll\n
help you out by declaring the winner after each round.\n

The game will be best of 3 format.\n

Press the Enter/Return key when you are ready to start. Good Luck!"
